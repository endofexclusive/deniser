== GHDL

To simulate with GHDL:

  cd ghdl
  make test

The terminal output should look something like this:

  BEGIN: joy0
  INFO  RGA: power-on
  sysfreq:  3571 KHz
  period:   280000000 fs
  --- simulation begin
  INFO  RGA: power-up reset done
  DEBUG RGA: write $03C <- $CAFE
  DEBUG RGA: write $08E <- $2C81
  DEBUG RGA: write $090 <- $F4C1
  DEBUG RGA: write $100 <- $2000
  DEBUG RGA: write $102 <- $0022
  DEBUG RGA: read  $00A -> $XXXX
  DEBUG RGA: write $036 <- $55AA
  DEBUG RGA: read  $00A -> $56AA
  --- simulation end
  END:   joy0

This test case writes to the Denise joystick-mouse
counters via the `JOYTEST` register (`$036`) and then reads the
`JOY0DAT` register (`$00A`), checking that the writable bits
are updated.

The GHDL testbenches write signal transitions to `.ghw` files
which can be displayed in the GTKWave waveform viewer.
