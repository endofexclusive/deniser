== Gate level simulation

The Lattice Diamond implementation flow writes netlist files in
VHDL format which can be used with simulation.
So instead of giving the simulator a high-level VHDL description
of the Deniser design, we give it a description represented by
the targets low-level building blocks (LUTs, registers, routing,
I/O pads, etc.).
The testbench and test cases are still represented by the
same high-level VHDL code as with the RTL simulation.

To simulate the FPGA design after place and route, issue:

  cd vsim-hw
  make distclean
  make TOP=../dia/build/toppar.vhdl test

The Make variable `TOP` selects the netlist top file.
You can find more VHDL netlists in the `dia/build` directory.
