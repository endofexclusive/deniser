== ModelSim

To simulate with ModelSim distributed with Lattice Diamond:

  cd vsim
  make test

An interactive ModelSim session is started using the `make launch` target.


The Make script can be used with "ModelSim Lattice FPGA Edition".
If you are using a different ModelSim distribution, then you may
need to compile and analyse the Lattice simulation libraries manually.
The models are installed with Diamond in
`cae_library/simulation/vhdl`.
Another option is to set TECH=0 in the Makefile to use the
technology-independent model.
