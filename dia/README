Troubleshooting the "make conf" target
======================================

To unload the Linux FTDI kernel driver:

  # rmmod ftdi_sio


The "Lattice Programmer Diamond" may complain about USB device
permission, with a message like this:

  libusb couldn't open USB device /dev/bus/usb/003/002: Permission denied.
  libusb requires write access to USB device nodes.

It can be solved by setting write permission to the device file.

  # chmod o+w /dev/bus/usb/003/002
